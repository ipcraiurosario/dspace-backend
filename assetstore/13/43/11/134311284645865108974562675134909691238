The intention of the research is to demonstrate whether the process of implementation of the articulation policy of the Educational Institution Francisco de Paula Santander and the Nationalized Technical Institution with the National Learning Service (SENA by Spanish acronym) meet the students' needs against the current national and regional situation. In order to achieve this it was imperative to tackle the problem through the following approaches: descriptive, explicative, analytic and propositional. Additionally, surveys were conducted to students, teachers and management teams of the educational institutions and interviews were performed to the regional director of the SENA and the departmental education secretary; all of this under the purpose of designing possible solutions to support the consolidation of the articulation process.","http://10.194.194.13:4000/handle/123456789/5","es",,,"La implementación del programa “revolución educativa” en la educación media técnica de la provincia centro del departamento de Boyacá (2002-2010)","Article"
